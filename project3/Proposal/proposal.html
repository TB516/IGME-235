    <h1>Project 3 proposal</h1>
    <p>
        I would like to make a tetris like game. To differentiate it, instead of getting the normal shapes, you would get a 3x3 cube, and be able to shoot parts out. To do this, you would control a ship/character like in space invaders, and shoot bullets that can destroy parts of the block. The game would end when you cant stack anymore blocks up. I would use PIXI for this assignment.
