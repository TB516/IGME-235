        <p>For my process, it was mainly just to get access to the API, then display data from it. That was what I had for the demo. Then, I worked on adding the filters and page buttons in to make it functional. Finally, I added the finishing touches like the loading wheel. For sources, all the ship images/data are from the WOWS API. Cant think of anything explicit to point out currently. I do wana note that the documentation button is last min so thats why it looks a bit out of place. I think an A to A- would probably be what id give myself cause it meets all the requirements for an A but has stuff to nitpick about it.</p>
